.SH NAME
airjack \- WiFi security testing tool for macOS

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B airjack
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B airjack
is a comprehensive WiFi security testing tool designed specifically for macOS systems.
It leverages the CoreWLAN framework to scan for available wireless networks, capture
WPA/WPA2/WPA3 handshakes using a capture backend (zizzania preferred, AirSnare optional),
and attempts to recover network passwords
using hashcat with dictionary or brute-force attacks.

.PP
The tool provides an interactive workflow that guides users through network selection,
handshake capture, and password cracking. It supports configuration files for persistent
settings and includes features like deauthentication attacks, custom wordlists, and
hashcat optimization.

.PP
.B WARNING:
This tool is for EDUCATIONAL AND AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING PURPOSES ONLY. Only use
on networks you own or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized access
to computer networks is illegal and punishable by law in most jurisdictions.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS Configuration Options
.TP
.BI \-c " FILE" ", \-\-config=" FILE
Read configuration from the specified file. Configuration files use INI format and can
specify defaults for most command-line options. The tool searches for configuration in
this order: 1) file specified with \fB\-c\fR, 2) \fI~/.airjack.conf\fR, 3) \fI/etc/airjack.conf\fR.
.TP
.BI \-C " PATH" ", \-\-create\-config=" PATH
Create a default configuration file at the specified path and exit. The generated file
includes all available options with their default values and explanatory comments.
Example: \fBairjack \-C ~/.airjack.conf\fR

.SS Tool Paths
These options override paths to external dependencies. By default, the tool searches
for tools in standard locations and uses paths from the configuration file.
.TP
.BI "\-\-hashcat\-path=" PATH
Full path to the hashcat executable. If not provided, AirJack uses the configuration
file value (when set) or auto-detects via \fB$PATH\fR/Homebrew before falling back to
\fI~/hashcat/hashcat\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-\-airsnare\-path=" PATH
Full path to the airsnare executable. If not provided, AirJack uses the configuration
file value (when set) or auto-detects via \fB$PATH\fR/Homebrew before falling back to
\fI~/airsnare/src/airsnare\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-\-zizzania\-path=" PATH
Full path to the zizzania executable. If not provided, AirJack uses the configuration
file value (when set) or auto-detects via \fB$PATH\fR/Homebrew before falling back to
\fI~/zizzania/src/zizzania\fR.

.SS Capture Backend
.TP
.BI "\-\-capture\-tool=" BACKEND
Select capture backend: \fBzizzania\fR (preferred) or \fBairsnare\fR. Default: auto
prefers zizzania when found, otherwise airsnare. Use this to force a specific tool.

.SS Network Selection
.TP
.BI \-i " INTERFACE" ", \-\-interface=" INTERFACE
Specify the wireless network interface to use for scanning and packet capture.
If not specified, the tool will auto-detect the first available WiFi interface.
Common values: \fBen0\fR, \fBen1\fR. Use \fBifconfig\fR to list available interfaces.
.TP
.BI \-n " INDEX" ", \-\-network\-index=" INDEX
Automatically select a network by its index number (1-based), skipping the interactive
network selection menu. Useful for scripting and automation. Example: \fB\-n 1\fR selects
the first network in the scan results.

.SS Capture Options
.TP
.B \-d\fR, \fB\-\-deauth
Enable deauthentication attacks during handshake capture. This forces connected clients
to disconnect and reconnect, triggering a WPA handshake. \fBWarning:\fR Only use on
networks you own. Deauthentication attacks may be illegal without authorization.
.TP
.BI "\-\-capture\-file=" FILE
Specify the output filename for the raw packet capture in pcap format.
Default: \fIcapture.pcap\fR. This file contains all captured WiFi frames and can be
analyzed with tools like Wireshark or tcpdump.
.TP
.BI "\-\-hashcat\-file=" FILE
Specify the output filename for the hashcat-compatible hash file in hc22000 format.
Default: \fIcapture.hc22000\fR. This file is generated from the pcap using hcxpcapngtool
and contains the extracted PMKID or EAPOL handshake data.

.SS Cracking Options
.TP
.BI \-m " MODE" ", \-\-mode=" MODE
Select the password cracking attack mode:
.RS
.IP \fB1\fR
Dictionary attack: tries passwords from a wordlist file (requires \fB\-w\fR).
.IP \fB2\fR
Brute-force attack: tries all combinations matching a pattern (requires \fB\-p\fR).
.IP \fB3\fR
Manual mode: prepares files but doesn't run hashcat, allowing manual cracking.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-w " FILE" ", \-\-wordlist=" FILE
Path to a wordlist file for dictionary attacks (mode 1). Each line should contain one
password candidate. Popular wordlists include rockyou.txt and crackstation.txt.
.TP
.BI \-p " PATTERN" ", \-\-pattern=" PATTERN
Hashcat mask pattern for brute-force attacks (mode 2). Use hashcat mask syntax:
.RS
.IP \fB?d\fR
Digit (0-9)
.IP \fB?l\fR
Lowercase letter (a-z)
.IP \fB?u\fR
Uppercase letter (A-Z)
.IP \fB?s\fR
Special character
.IP \fB?a\fR
All printable ASCII characters
.PP
Example: "\fB?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d\fR" tests all 8-digit numbers.
.RE
.TP
.B \-o\fR, \fB\-\-optimize
Enable hashcat kernel optimization (\fB\-O\fR flag). This can significantly increase
cracking speed but limits maximum password length to 32 characters. Recommended for
most use cases.

.SS Miscellaneous Options
.TP
.BI "\-\-auth\-timeout=" SECONDS
Timeout in seconds for macOS Location Services authorization. On first run, macOS
will prompt for location permission (required by CoreWLAN). If authorization is not
granted within this timeout, the tool exits. Default: 60 seconds.
.TP
.B \-\-cleanup
Automatically delete capture files (\fIcapture.pcap\fR and \fIcapture.hc22000\fR) after
completion. Useful for maintaining operational security by removing evidence. Use with
caution.
.TP
.B \-\-dry\-run
Simulate the complete workflow without actually running external tools (hashcat, airsnare,
hcxpcapngtool). Useful for testing configuration and debugging. Shows what commands would
be executed.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-missing
Continue execution even if required external tools (hashcat, airsnare, hcxpcapngtool)
are not found. Useful for partial testing or when tools are installed in non-standard
locations.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-banner
Suppress the ASCII art banner on startup. Useful for scripting or when running in
non-interactive environments.
.TP
.B \-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose
Enable verbose output showing detailed progress information, debug messages, and
command execution details. Helpful for troubleshooting issues.

.SH FILES
The following files are used by airjack for configuration and output:
.TP
.I ~/.airjack.conf
Per-user configuration file in INI format. This file is checked after any file specified
with \fB\-c\fR but before the system-wide configuration. Create with \fBairjack \-C ~/.airjack.conf\fR.
.TP
.I /etc/airjack.conf
System-wide configuration file. Used as a fallback if no user configuration exists.
Requires root permissions to modify.
.TP
.I capture.pcap
Default output file for raw WiFi packet captures in pcap format. Contains beacon frames,
probe requests/responses, and EAPOL handshake packets. Can be analyzed with Wireshark,
tcpdump, or other packet analysis tools.
.TP
.I capture.hc22000
Default output file for hashcat-compatible password hashes in hc22000 format. Generated
from the pcap file using hcxpcapngtool. Contains PMKID or EAPOL handshake data suitable
for password cracking with hashcat.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
Configuration files use standard INI format with sections and key=value pairs. Lines
starting with \fB#\fR or \fB;\fR are treated as comments.
